# pyhton-challenge
Module OS failed in my Visual Studio Code, so I couldn't place the file path. I was forced to place the csv file in the outer folder PyBank and PyPoll respectively.
Once we run the code, a txt file is created in the same folder where main.py folder is localed. This was also a consequence of the Module OS malfunction.
I had a message that said "'os' is not accessed Pylance." And always got a message saying "file not found in location".
Also my Visual Studio was not able to run the PyPoll python code, I tried reinstalling Visual Studio and using my GitBASH but had no luck. For the PyBank code there was no problem. Nevertheless it should run without any problem.
